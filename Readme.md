Summary
=======

The goal of this study is to check whether automatic transmission has an
impact on MPG in cars. We have a dataset of 32 cars with 11 measurement
of them such as MPG, weight, displacement etc. We use regression
analysis to check for the impact of transmission type.

At the end we will see that, although it seems at the first look that
automatic transmission decreases MPG but this is not an statistically
meaningful conclusion.
